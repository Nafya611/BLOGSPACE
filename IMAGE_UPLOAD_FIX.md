# Image Upload Fix - Action Plan

## Current Issue
Image uploads are failing after Cloudinary integration.

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Added Cloudinary credentials to `.env`
2. ✅ Created custom CloudinaryStorage class
3. ✅ Updated Post model to use custom storage
4. ✅ Updated requirements.txt with cloudinary package
5. ✅ Simplified Django settings
6. ✅ Updated PostSerializer for Cloudinary URLs

## Next Steps to Fix

### 1. Rebuild and Start Containers
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Check Logs for Errors
```bash
docker-compose logs app
```

### 3. Test Cloudinary Connection
Run the test_cloudinary.py script to verify credentials work.

### 4. Create/Run Migrations
```bash
docker-compose exec app python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose exec app python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Test Image Upload
Try uploading an image through the frontend interface.

## Troubleshooting

### If containers won't start:
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Verify .env file has correct Cloudinary credentials
- Ensure no syntax errors in Python files

### If image uploads still fail:
- Check Django logs for specific error messages
- Verify Cloudinary credentials are loaded in container
- Check network connectivity to Cloudinary

### If images don't display:
- Check the URL being generated in the API response
- Verify Cloudinary URLs are accessible
- Check browser console for image loading errors

## Fallback Option
If Cloudinary continues to have issues, we can temporarily revert to local file storage:

1. Change Post model back to regular ImageField
2. Remove custom storage
3. Use local media files for development
4. Add Cloudinary later once issues are resolved
